              <p class="lead">I graduated from the University of Kent in 2019 with a Upper Second Class in BSc Chemistry with Honours. After my undergraduate degree, I continued on at Kent with a Masters via Research in Chemistry, specifically focusing on organic energy storage alternatives.</p>
              <p class="lead">I've always had a huge interest in Software Development, specifically Front End and Web Development utilising HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more recently React. However, I also have some very basic self-taught knowledge of object orientated languages such as Python and C++.</p>
              <p class="lead">I am currently looking for Entry-Level Front-End Engineering Roles, ideally within a company that will allow for me to utilise my degree knowledge however, securing an opportunity to develop my skills within the sector is of an absolute priority for me.</p>
